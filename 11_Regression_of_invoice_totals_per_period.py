# i talked to dave about this
# he recommends trying a handful of different approaches, e.g. simple OLS regression, maybe based on 2025 data only because 
# the shape of the invoice totals cruve changes after start of 2025.
# dont let it stop you from using all data also
# can also try a simple time series regression, maybe ChatGPT can give us some suggestions on methods.
# we can look at trying to model month-by-month, or cumulatively. just try whatever you think might works
