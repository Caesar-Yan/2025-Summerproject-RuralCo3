"# 2025-Summerproject-RuralCo3"  

In this project, we need to evaluate both the direct financial gains from canceling
the late-payment discount and the potential impact on customers. The final objective
is to determine whether the net benefit can cover the associated costs, and to estimate
the remaining surplus.

Therefore, the code structure can be divided into two main parts:

1. Calculate the direct revenue generated from discount cancellation.
2. Analyze the customer impact caused by discount removal, including potential
   customer churn and the resulting financial loss.

Below is an initial implementation for Part 1: computing the direct revenue from
discount cancellation. Further adjustments may be made as needed based on the data
and project requirements.
